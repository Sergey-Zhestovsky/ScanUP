### Specific Terms for ScanUP Sings
ScanUP Sings (“ScanUP Sings”), which is part of the ScanUP Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool, available on PC, iOS, and Android. It allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal ScanUP channel, and to create and share VODs with users of ScanUP and other users of ScanUP Sings. All game activity can be streamed to ScanUP without any additional software.

Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans. Bonus: if you use the ScanUP Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to ScanUP, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.

Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:

Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;

Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in ScanUP Sings; and

Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room). Conduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.

To make available musical works from a variety of artists within ScanUP Sings (from rock to pop), ScanUP negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks. The licenses granted to ScanUP allow ScanUP to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with ScanUP Sings and the ScanUP Services. ScanUP Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the ScanUP Services. What this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:

make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a ScanUP Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);

assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in ScanUP Sings; or

use your performance from ScanUP Sings outside the ScanUP Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on ScanUP. However, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.

Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents. 

Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time. Thus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from ScanUP Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws). This may mean that ScanUP will be required to take down previously recorded performances. ScanUP takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of ScanUP Sings.
